This course introduces you to the world of programming in the Python language. In a practical way, you will gradually learn from the basic treatment of variables to the programming of algorithms to build your own games. In addition, you will become familiar with the fundamental concepts for the development of algorithms and their programming.

At the end of the course, you will be able to develop your own Python programs and continue exploring to build new and increasingly complex programs. This course is the first step to becoming a professional with basic programming skills and opening the door to the future.
